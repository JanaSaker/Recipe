# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

I HAVE ONE HOUR TO DO THIS WEBSITE USING NODEJS EXPRESSJS REACTJS AND MYSQL 
I want the user to be with 2 different roles admin and user 
a very advanced ai integration in the controller (Add real NLP using compromise, natural, or LangChain.
Integrate OpenAI API for semantic recipe generation.
Use embedding-based search (e.g., via vector DB)

Modularity – Separates logic into smaller helper functions.

Natural Language Understanding – Supports basic synonym and semantic matching.

Scoring System – Ranks recipes by relevance.

Sanitization – Makes prompt safe and standardized.

Scalable Design – Easier to plug in real AI or NLP later.)
i want the search bar to be with filters of all the attributes in the table 

anyone can enter the website but only the registered users can edit on it.

let the design be responsive on all devices and be advanced design

add toast notifications

add a language switcher

add a loader telling waking up the chef
